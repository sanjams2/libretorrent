		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			What is this? This is a free, mail-based library. Books can be requested below and they will be mailed to you anywhere in the United States at no cost to you. Once you are done with your book, you can request postage for shipping the book to the next person who wants it (which is me if no one else has requested it).
		</p>
		<p>
			Why am I doing this? I have a bunch of books sitting in my basement collecting dust. I would rather them go to someone who wants them (i.e. someone who has found them on this site and specifically requested them) than donate them somewhere where their utilization probably wont be maximized. At the end of the day I dont really care too much about the books themselves so if I lose them so be it. However, I do hope that users feel compelled by the goodwilled nature of this endevaour to continue to send the books on when they are done with them so that others might benefit from them as well.

			Why is the site called LibreTorrent? I want this to be a peer-to-peer, mail-based library. BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer internet protocol, libre means book in latin and booktorrent.com was far to expensive. Kind of cheesy, but oh well.
